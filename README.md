# Hangman MP CLI

An online multiplayer cli game of hangman using requests from [hangman server](https://github.com/Samarth-Pai/hangmanServer) hosted on glitch

I agree the mulitplayer mode of the game won't run fast for the obvious reason that the server is set on free plan and we cant expect more from it :-(

## Modes in the game:

* Single player

* Multiplayer
    * Complete with stranger

## Hangman Server

Github: <https://github.com/Samarth-Pai/hangmanServer>

Glitch: <https://glitch.com/~hangman-server>

## Developer note

Please note that this is only for demonstration purposes for the public and is not fit for production level

It's my sincere requests not to hack or cheat in the game to maintain a healthy gaming environment ;-)

Please raise an issue as the program hasn't been tested enough
